**Hey, I'm Asmi Singh ðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to my corner of the coding world!
My love for programming began in class 12 when I was introduced to basic coding at high school.
Since then, I started my own endeavour in the world of programming, beginning with basic HTML, Python and CSS.

As a university student now, I have grown to appreciate the art of fundamental problem-solving, data structures and alogorithms, object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and much more.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my horizon in order to not only just grow as a developer and improve my technical skills, but also as an effective changemaker and problem-solver who can tackle any obstacle and learn to communicate most efficiently.
